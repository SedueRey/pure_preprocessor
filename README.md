Yui PureCSS.io for LESS/SASS/SCSS preprocessors
==================

Hi!

This is a fork from purecss.io and I (hope we) just want to use this amazing library of CSS in our projects in LESS/SASS/SCSS. I (we) will try to update every version of pureCSS.io to be used with your favorite preprocessor.

I'll try to make the v0.2.0 like PureCSS as soon as posible.

If you just need the CSS in your project please go to purecss.io and download it. It's awesome!
